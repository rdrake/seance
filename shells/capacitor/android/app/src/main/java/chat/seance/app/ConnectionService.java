/**
 * The "stay connected" foreground service (Settings → General → Background
 * connection, {@link KeepAlivePlugin}).
 *
 * It does no networking of its own: the IRC WebSockets live in the WebView,
 * inside MainActivity's process. What the service changes is that process's
 * standing with the OS. Without it a backgrounded app is a cached process:
 * Doze cuts its network within minutes of the screen going off and the
 * low-memory killer takes it whenever it likes, which is how a backgrounded
 * Seance came back with every network disconnected. A process running a
 * foreground service keeps its network through Doze and is not a candidate
 * for that reclaim, at the price of a persistent notification — which is
 * why this is opt-in. The service holds no wake lock: an incoming PING
 * wakes the process to answer, and the client sends nothing on a timer.
 *
 * The service is only ever useful while the WebView is alive, so it stops
 * itself when the task is swiped away ({@link #onTaskRemoved}) and when the
 * activity is destroyed for good (the plugin's handleOnDestroy, which sits
 * out a configuration change) — never left running with nothing to keep.
